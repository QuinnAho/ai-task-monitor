# Task Checklist: TASK_003_file_access_layer

## Pre-execution
- [x] Read task.json, acceptance criteria, ai/AI_TASK_MONITOR_CONTRACT.md, docs/requirements_architecture.md, and docs/schema_strategy.md
- [x] Review schemas under /schemas to understand validation targets
- [x] Decide on project structure for src/fs module and confirm directories exist

## Execution
- [x] Define TypeScript interfaces/types for file operations (read, write, list, append) and mode settings
- [x] Implement `src/fs/fileAccess.ts` with atomic write helper (temp file + rename) and schema validation hooks
- [x] Add read-only enforcement logic rejecting write attempts with descriptive errors/logging
- [x] Integrate structured logging (console + optional file stream) for operations including rejection reasons
- [x] Write unit tests (`src/fs/fileAccess.test.ts`) covering successful read/write, read-only rejection, error paths
- [x] Document API usage, mode toggles, and logging strategy in `docs/file_access_layer.md`
- [x] Update ai/templates or scripts (if needed) to leverage the new module (see scripts/generate_task_from_template.ts)
- [x] Log progress in progress.ndjson after major milestones

## Validation
- [x] Run unit tests and ensure all pass
- [x] Execute `node scripts/validate_schemas.mjs` (if touched JSON/Markdown) to confirm compliance
- [x] Verify checklist and acceptance criteria satisfied; ensure docs have Machine Summary Blocks

## Completion
- [x] Mark checklist items `[x]` when validated
- [x] Append `task_completed` entry to progress.ndjson
- [x] Update ai/tasks/current_index.json to reflect task status
