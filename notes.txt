I would like for each note on the ndjson there was like a mini line diff implementation to see what was changed maybe commit after each step add to the contract

saved prompts already for created tasks master prompt qa check. from the templates

cluade and codex editor: .claude, .agents

Little claude and codex logos based of what did what task in the progress log

in the progress log, we should have

website shows progress steps and analytics  

After the task module is complete is should keep track of all the files its touched, this might be accomplished and populated automatically woth the code diff feature

after a task module is complete add a task summary.

When reasoning on a task module, say use reasoning model or something similar.

There needs to be an init function, that creates all the templates architecture, you should be able to select the project you want, we should rename the master prompt to something generic
so that it is the same for all proejcts which needs to my next requirment

everytime we open the software we should perform a check that the json are in the right format and the project has the right arrchtiecture (ai folder) in general, we should try to make things generic and give input parameters for project specifics

when init is used we should also give prompts like task creation qa ect

it should also generate a claude and agents file that just tells to always refer to the central contract so that we keep things in one place

problems, ai likes to forget

great results require great prompting

maybe a markdown viewer of all your docs
